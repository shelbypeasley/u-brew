<p>This app is made for coffee enthusiests that need a place to store all of the information
associated with each coffee they try. Whether you're a barista trying to better your craft
or an at home coffee chemist trying to brew the best cup, uBrew can help. Create a profile
and start adding coffees that you have tasted or are going to taste. Next, add details to
each coffee like brew times, brew ratios, and more. Then, share your findings with coworkers
and friends, or use it for your own personal research<p>
